 Report Draft - Ideas:

Aim:
- Investigate current approaches for creating interactive data visualisations through R on the web (HTMLwidgets such as Plotly, rbokeh, the ggvis package, possibly trelliscopeJS? and tools to enhance these widgets such as Shiny, crosstalk)
- Investigate tools that do interactive data visualisation, but are currently not on the web and their limitations and how they compare to those that are currently on the web
- Could we design something better for users?

Possible outline:
- Why should we make a transition from static to interactive plots/data visuals?
- Why the web?
- Current solutions:
-> Introductions to each of these HTMLwidgets/ packages (also give brief introduction to how the web works/browser rendering + DOM, and what an HTMLwidget does)
->  Similarities and differences between each of these, and the main limitations for these (highlight these either by referencing to challenges and examples)
-> Introductions to iPlots and Mondrian (which both run on Java) and why aren't they being used as much as Shiny, and investigate similarities and differences, + pros and cons for this
-> Visualisations on the web that successfully visualise huge datasets
- Identify what would users want from an interactive data visual, and how we could go about to solving these problems?




- Build solution that aims to solve the limitations.
