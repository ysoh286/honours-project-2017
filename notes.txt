DISCUSS:

  + interactive graphics example (requiring stand-alone solution with
    no R in the background)
    - R-help 2017-04-23 from Chris Battiston
      "trying to find a way to create a series of interconnected graphs where I have a filter (either a drop down or series of checkboxes) where when an option is selected, all graphs are updated to show that group’s data.  I need to keep these graphs internal to our organization, so can’t use Shiny etc.; I am also unable to run R or other products on my server (company policy)."

  + implement a plotly parallelplot ?

TODO:

  + think about how *you* would like to express a solution to the
    3 challenges (rather than having to think in terms of how 
    plotly/shiny/crosstalk work)
    - pseudocode
    - concepts
    - diagrams ...

  + different implementations of plot with trend line plus slider (for
    trend line parameter) WHERE ONLY the trend line is updated when
    the slide moves
    - Shiny + gridSVG + javascript (D3?)
    - DOM + gridSVG + javascript (D3?)

TODO:

  + R <-> Shiny <-> JS

    - we can be in R directing Shiny and getting prompts from Shiny;
      can we be in JS directing Shiny and getting prompts from Shiny ?

DISCUSS:

  + do we have an example of shiny + crosstalk + plotly ?
    - not yet

  + another challenge from Chris:
    - array of plots, all linked, where you can click on one to
      get a view of just that single plot, but it is still interactive
      (e.g., tooltips) and it still has current selection  
      => you could used linked brushing on the array of plots then
         zoom in to explore the selected points on just one plot
      + what about if the click popped a new browser tab or window,
        so you can still see the array of plots as well as the single plot
        (and they are all linked)


DONE:

  + challenges from last time:
    - scatter with smooth line
      + doable with ggvis
      + not sure yet about plotly
      + could iplots do this ?

  + plotly event_data() "curve number" column corresponds to group id

  + shiny + plotly
    - can do facetting, though it is a bit manual
      + build multiple plots then combine via subplot() 
        (with possibility to share x-scale and y-scale between plots)
    - event_data("plotly_selected") only works on scatterplots (?)
      + i.e., region selection (as opposed to single click)

  + shiny + ggvis
    - ggvis has its own widgets (like shiny), but it does not allow
      control over the arrangement of widgets relative to plot or page

  + crosstalk
    - there is no R code to produce redraws, so maybe only update
      messages/info gets sent between R and htmlwidgets?
    - if Yu Han cannot figure it out, Paul can email Joe Cheng


TODO:

  + start to build a list of "challenges" that help us to describe the
    boundary where the existing tools start to get difficult or 
    impossible to use
    - boxplot interaction
    - smoother with slider
    - array of plots to drill into

  + try to tackle the challenges using existing tools
    - what is easy?
    - what is hard?
    - what is impossible?
    
  + where existing tools fail (or are awkward), produce implementation
    using gridSVG/javascript
    - try to draw out an underlying structure so that do not have to
      start from scratch each time
    - try to build functions that can be reused (and others could reuse)
    - where on the convenience/customisation scale do we want to be?

DISCUSS:

  + 'shiny' brushedPoints() does have limitations
    - always wants x and y coords, so does not work with boxplot of 1 variable
    - does not work with 'lattice' (you can get x/y location of mouse, but
      you have to do the mapping to data coordinates yourself AND it is not
      clear what coordinate system the mouse x/y is in)
      
  + examples of "challenging" interactions that Chris or Paul would like
    - scatter plot with smooth line; change smoothness of line WITHOUT
      having to redraw entire plot (because redraw of plot might be slow
      if have lots of points)
    - click on a boxplot to select all data from median to LQ in data set

  + having a standalone interactive plot (NOT connected to R) is nice
    for being able to share plots


TODO:

  + swap github repo URLs with Shan-I 

  + investigate 'shiny' + 'plotly' a bit
    - can it do facetting?
    - can it do other types of plots?

    - what do all the columns mean in the data frame that event_data() returns?
      + especially the "curve" one ?  is this some sort of group label ?

  + investigate 'shiny' + 'ggvis' a bit more
    - can it do facetting?
    - can it do other types of plots?
    
  + investigate 'crosstalk' a bit more
    - does it force complete redraws (like 'shiny' does) ?


2017-03-23

DISCUSS:

  + 'shiny' has brushedPoints() for brushing a plot and having something
    else on the page update
    - appears to work with base plots, ggplot2, and ggvis (at least)


TODO:

  + where are the limits of 'shiny's brushedPoints() ?
    - 'lattice' plots ?
    - multipanel/facetted plots ?
    - boxplots ?
    - dotplots ?
    - can you link plot to another plot?
    - can you link plot to itself ? (e.g., colour brushed points)

DISCUSS:

  + linked plot and table with ...
    - 'rplotly'
      + can do it via 'crosstalk' with 'plotly' and 'DT' (data.table)
        - generally can link any 'htmlwidgets' package (e.g., 'leaflet')
        - AS LONG AS the package has been integrated with 'crosstalk'
        - uses "shared data object" as common data between linked elements
          (changes to data flow to changes in linked elements?)
        - limited to filtering and linked brushing
        - limited to small data
        - classic trade-off between (major) ease-of-use for supported things
          but (major) headache to customise
        - uses 'bootstrap' underneath to build and layout HTML page 
          (standard framework for responsive HTML pages)
      + not sure yet whether can get access to the HTML/SVG/js that 'plotly'   
        is generating (to do further manual customisation)
    - 'rbokeh'
      + can't do it yet
      + 'bokeh' can itself do it
        - does its own plots, tables, etc
        - standard (full) API is Python
        - R API needs expanding
        - not designed to link to things outside bokeh
    - 'ggvis'/'rvega'
      + both stale/stagnated ?
      + both use Shiny's reactive engine to interact with browser?


TODO:

  + record notes (incl URLs) in text file on computer

  + create a github repo to store (and share) notes, images, code, ...

  + do the linked-plot-table thing with 'Shiny'

  + follow up 'ggvis'/'rvega' to check that they can actually 
    talk back to R!?
    - which 'plotly' and 'crosstalk' etc do NOT do (right?)

  + (for the future) look at D3 with 'gridSVG' output

DISCUSS:

  + goals are:

    - interactive plots (from iNZight)
      + plot + table
      + multipanel plots
      + linked brushing (select in one plot, highlight in another)
      + communication back to R ?
        (what was selected, recalculate a fitted line, ...)


TODO:

  + plot using 'rbokeh', table using 'xtable', LINK the two
  + ditto 'plotly'
  + ditto 'highcharts'?
  + ditto 'rvega'?
  + ditto 'ggvis'?


2017-03-02
----------

PLAN:

  + get an 'rbokeh'/'plotly' plot going
  + get an 'rbokeh'/'plotly' plot going from iNZight
  + get a 'DataTable' table 
  + link the plot to the table

  
DISCUSS:

  + Paul/Chris confirm project with Brendon

  + project topic ...

    "using gridSVG to create charts/plots, and implement
     interactivity/animation with javascript libraries such as d3 or
     Raphael.js as mentioned on Paul's student project idea page.

     It may help create more high level interactivity graphs for
     iNZight for future development"

  + Make existing code (from Summer) more robust

  + New starts ...

    - use D3 rather than raw javascript
    - use something like highcharts (via htmlwidgets)
      http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_datatables.html
      http://www.htmlwidgets.org/showcase_plotly.html 

    - compare the different approaches
      + integrating difference components on a page
      + customising and extending components

  + New things ...

    - use 'DOM' to get the SVG to the browser (and talk back)
    - integration with iNZight
    - zooming interaction
    - linked brushing
