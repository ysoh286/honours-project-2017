## Abstract {#abstract}

Web interactive graphics have become popular for sharing exploratory data
analysis. There are many approaches for creating web interactive
graphics, however, they are limited and do not allow users to customise certain
interactions. This report gives an overview of existing tools for creating web interactive
plots before developing and discussing a more flexible solution called **interactr**,
a prototype package that allows users to customise interactions on plots produced
in R and aims to remove the need for understanding how web technologies work.

## Acknowledgements {#acknowledgements}

Thank you to Dr. Paul Murrell for his technical expertise and witty analogies
that helped me understand the concepts and challenges of research and software
development. Thank you for being an inspirational role model for becoming a
better programmer.

Thank you to Prof. Chris Wild for introducing me to the idea of interactive
graphics, for inspiring me to investigate further into this topic for iNZight
and for my own interests. Thank you for sharing ideas and challenging me further.

This project would not have been possible without their dedicated supervision
and support. I hope that it has helped in their own research and inspires others
to have fun making their own interactive visuals in R.
