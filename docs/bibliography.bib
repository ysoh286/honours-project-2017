Abstract = {The gridSVG package can be used to generate a grid-based R plot in an SVG format, with the ability to add special effects to the plot. The special effects include animation, interactivity, and advanced graphical features, such as masks and filters. This article provides a basic introduction to important functions in the gridSVG package and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of gridSVG compared to similar R packages.
