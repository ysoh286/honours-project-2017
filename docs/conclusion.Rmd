# Conclusion
There is more that can be achieved in expanding interactive graphics to create better data visualisations for users. Despite having many tools available such as htmlwidgets, ggvis and shiny, these generally produce standard interactive plots outside of R without allowing the user to further extend or customize interactions easily. There is a possible solution to allow the control and creation of simple interactive R plots through the interactr package. This provides a way of driving interactions without the need of learning too many tools, while utilising R's power of statistical computing to aid changes in plots. However, more assessment and development is required on building more sophisticated interactive visualisations before it can be used in the future.

## Additional resources
The **interactr** package is currently hosted on Github [here](https://github.com/ysoh286/interactr).

To install **interactr**:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('ysoh286/interactr')
```
