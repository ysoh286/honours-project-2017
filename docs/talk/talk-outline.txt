Talk outline:
- 15 minutes + 5 mins Q & A

Notes:
- It doesn't have to follow the report
- The purpose of the talk is to provide highlights about the project and
	WHY it's important
- WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT??
	 - what did you solve?
	 - how did you solve it?
	 - DID you solve it?
- Possible idea from Paul: could have literally have a series of examples
that you just walk through and talk about limitations + advantages (this works,
this doesn't... this doesn't quite - without all this code *and show off all this blah)

TODOS:
- 5 main things you want to express
- Draft plan
- Slides
- Practice talk

What are the 5 main things I want the audience to know and take away?

PURPOSE/PROBLEM (WHY):
- need for web interactive graphics: exploratory data analysis
- provide web interactive graphics to advance features in iNZight/ R plotting systems
	WITHOUT too much work + with FLEXIBILITY

APPROACH (HOW):
- look at existing tools (plotly, shiny, ggvis, animint)
- assess advantages/disadvantages

SUBPROBLEMS:
- redrawing entire plots when not necessary
- not provided for R plots (except for ggplot2)
- tradeoff: higher level tools great for some interactivity, others not so much, meanwhile
	lower level tools require too much work to coordinate

SOLUTION:
- The interactr package aims to provide flexibility in creating web interactive
graphics based upon graphical elements present in R. (an in-between solution + proof of concept!)

FUTURE:
- web interactive graphics still remains 'hot' in demand and dynamic in nature

5 POINTERS:
(1 - WHY) The need for web interactive graphics for exploratory data analysis
is becoming more important
(2 - PROBLEM) Investigate existing tools and find a way to provide web interactive graphics
to static R plots (including lattice, ggplot2, graphics and eventually
iNZight) WITHOUT too much work + extensible to customise certain interactions
(3 - A KEY FINDING) Some good current tools provide certain types of interactivity
basically effort free. A huge effort in doing anything beyond what is canned (what the investigation shows).
(4 - SOLUTION TO PROBLEM) interactr aims to provide flexibility in creating web interactive
plots based upon graphical elements drawn in R. (a solution that lies between 'high level'
and 'low level' + proof of concept)
(5 - FUTURE DIRECTION/CONCLUDE) Web interactive graphics still remains dynamic, but there's still a
	long way to go before all these tools can catch up to older desktop applications + provide interactions
	that are important for statistical analysis
