Talk outline:
- 15 minutes + 5 mins Q & A 

Slides: 10-15?

1 - title slide : Web interactive plots in R

2 - What is interactive graphics + why do we need it?
	- briefly mention why the web?
  - Problem: investigate web interactive graphics
  - Process:
	- what's out there + limitations
	- introduce interactr
	- mention :) and :(
	
3 - plotly, plotly + crosstalk?

4 - shiny 

5 - Others: ggvis + animint (or namedrop) + other htmlwidgets

6 - Main limitations:
	- tendency to reproduce entire plots
	MY PROBLEM STILL EXISTS
	- I can't customise interactions into the plot or add layers
	- Not without expert knowledge and knowing web tech :(
	
7 - Jumping down to lower level tools and establishing 
	building blocks
	- gridSVG, JavaScript, shiny
	- gridSVG + DOM
	- Not ideal - majority of statisticians don't know JavaScript/HTML/CSS
	(why shiny is so popular and successful!) 
	- great for customisation, but requires heaps of effort

9 - A more general solution??
	- introduce interactr + main idea diagram

10 - examples

11 - examples /demo??

12 - Happiness is here!  :) - discuss advantages

13 - ...though, a little short lived  :( - discuss limitations 

14 - Key takeaways:
	- My problem's half solved (still developing + only a proof-of-concept)
	- Need for better interactive tools
	- Might take a while before everything can catch up to the capabilities of desktop applications
	 - Thank you, questions?
	 (please don't ask me about the DOM server)
