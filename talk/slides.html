# Web interactive plots in R

---


## What is interactive graphics?

## Why do we need it?

## Problem

## Approach
- investigate what tools are out there?
- What are they good/bad at?
- introduce interactr - a package for making your static R plot into something a little more interactive!

---

## plotly


- compatible with crosstalk for linking multiple views (standalone, therefore sharable)

---

## shiny

- establishes a connection to R
---

## ...and other tools!

ggvis

animint

...and other htmlwidgets
 - rCharts
 - googleVis
 - rbokeh
 - DT
 - Leaflet

---

## Problems?
- tendency to reproduce entire plots
- I can't customise or add interactions onto the plot
  - not without expert knowledge + knowing web tech :(

---

## Jumping down the ladder...

- Many of the tools are considered 'higher' level tools.
- Jumping down lower gives us more flexibility and allows us to customise interactions
  - gridSVG
  - DOM
  - shiny's 'JavaScript messaging'

---

## Example: A moving trend line


---

## BUT...

- This is not ideal!
  - majority of statisticians don't know Javascript
  - requires too much effort :(

---

## The tradeoff

- Balance between simplicity vs flexibility

**Could we make something that's a bit more general, and a bit more flexible?**

---

## A more general solution...?

The main idea...


- gridSVG + grid + DOM = interactr
- provides functions to help make your static plot in R into something interactive!
- Based upon graphical elements present rather than data

---

## Examples


---

## Advantages
- Compatible with plots drawn with grid, including ggplot2 + lattice
- Compatible with plots drawn in base R (via gridGraphics)
- Only updates specific components of the plot

---

## Limitations
-
---

## Key takeaways

- There is potential need for better interactive tools that can be viewed on the web
- the world of web interactive graphics remains dynamic, and will continue to evolve - but it'll take a bit of time before it can catch up to the capabilities of desktop applications
