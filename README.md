# Honours Project 2017:

###### Aim:
- Compare different approaches of achieving plot interactions through R to the web browser
- Is it possible to achieve customized/extended interactions for the user from a developer's perspective easily using these approaches?
- Using all the knowledge/research above, ideally try develop something that could be used for iNZight + a generalized version for developers to easily use, customise, and extend to meet users' needs
