 Report Draft - Ideas:

Aim:
- Investigate current approaches for creating interactive data visualisations through R on the web (HTMLwidgets such as Plotly, rbokeh, the ggvis package, possibly trelliscopeJS? and tools to enhance these widgets such as Shiny, crosstalk)
- Investigate tools that do interactive data visualisation, but are currently not on the web and their limitations and how they compare to those that are currently on the web
- Could we design something better for users?

Possible outline:
- Why should we make a transition from static to interactive plots/data visuals?
- Why the web?
- Current solutions:
-> Introductions to each of these HTMLwidgets/ packages (also give brief introduction to how the web works/browser rendering + DOM, and what an HTMLwidget does)
->  Similarities and differences between each of these, and the main limitations for these (highlight these either by referencing to challenges and examples)
-> Introductions to iPlots and Mondrian (which both run on Java) and why aren't they being used as much as Shiny, and investigate similarities and differences, + pros and cons for this
-> Visualisations on the web that successfully visualise huge datasets
- Identify what would users want from an interactive data visual, and how we could go about to solving these problems?




- Build solution that aims to solve the limitations.

Current Structure:
1 - Introduction - why web interactive? why make from static to interactive? Motivation?
2 - Problem/aim addressed? What do users want? Is there a way of making your own interactive visuals easily?
3 - Existing tools for creating web interactive plots in R
  These are tools that automatically generate web interactive plots and only require knowledge of R
    - HTMLWidgets
      - Plotly
      - rbokeh
    - ggvis
    - crosstalk
    - shiny
  For each, discuss the pros and cons for each.
  - Comparison to non-web tools: iPlots (Mondrian/rggobi/cranvas??)
4 - Extending limitations with other tools
  These tools require a knowledge of web tech - HTML/CSS/JS/DOM manipulation
    - gridSVG
    - DOM
  Discuss which limitations have been solved, while what has appeared.
  - Ways in which we could try and solve these limitations?
  - Other tools that are outside of R that could help or achieve what we want
5 - Proposed solutions


6 - Conclusion
