Web interactive graphics have become popular for sharing exploratory data
analysis. There are many approaches for creating web interactive
graphics, however, they are limited and do not allow users to customise and introduce
interactions that were not specifically planned for by these systems.
This report gives an overview of existing tools for creating web interactive
plots before developing and discussing a more flexible solution called
\textsf{interactr},
a prototype package that allows users to customise interactions on plots produced
in R and aims to remove the need for understanding how web technologies work.
