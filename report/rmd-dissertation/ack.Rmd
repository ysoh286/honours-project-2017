# Acknowledgements{-}

Thank you to Dr. Paul Murrell for his technical expertise and witty analogies
that helped me understand the concepts and challenges of research and software
development. Thank you for being an inspirational role model to allow me to become
 a better programmer.

Thank you to Prof. Chris Wild for introducing me to the idea of interactive
graphics, for inspiring me to investigate further into this topic for iNZight
and for my own interests. Thank you for sharing ideas and challenging me further.

This project would not have been possible without their dedicated supervision
and support. I hope that it has helped them in their own research and inspires others
to have fun making their own interactive visuals in R.
